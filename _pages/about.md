I am a graduate student at MIT in [Physics, Statistics and Data Science](https://physics.mit.edu/academic-programs/graduate-students/psds-phd/). 
My doctoral research lies at the intersection of machine learning and gravitational wave astronomy. I have developed [several](/projects/#Research) deep learning algorithms for analyzing gravitational wave data, with a focus on real time applications to enable [multi-messenger astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-messenger_astronomy).

I recieved my undergraduate degree from Northwestern in 2019 with a double major in Mathematics and Physics.
In my free time, I enjoy playing and watching soccer.
