With colleagues at MIT and collaborators at University of Minnesota (UMN), we've deployed a 
real-time, deep-learning-based binary-black-hole search, [Aframe](/projects/aframe), and parameter estimation algorithm, [AMPLFI](amplfi) into production. This is the first time deep-learning is being used 
together for both detection and parameter estimation of gravitational wave sources. See [this announcement](https://cse.umn.edu/mifa/news/umn-and-mit-launch-first-real-time-machine-learning-search-colliding-black-holes) from UMN for more information.


Compared with traditional statistical methods, deep learning approaches are faster and have a smaller computational footprint.
Traditional statistical techniques will always have their place in science due to their interpretability. 
Still, this represents the beginning of a paradigm shift in how gravitational wave data analysis can be performed.


Detecting sources as quickly is possible is critical for maximizing the potential of multi-messenger astronomy.
Here's an example [GCN circular](https://gcn.nasa.gov/circulars/41601?view=index&query=S250830m+&startDate=&endDate=&sort=circularID) distributed to the astronomical community that Aframe and AMPLFI contributed to.

TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR
NUMBER:  41601
SUBJECT: LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA S250830m: Identification of a GW compact binary merger candidate
DATE:    25/08/30 04:40:26 GMT
FROM:    Jyotirmaya Mohanta at University of Tsukuba  <s2430161@u.tsukuba.ac.jp>

The LIGO Scientific Collaboration, the Virgo Collaboration, and the KAGRA Collaboration report:

We identified the compact binary merger candidate S250830m during real-time processing of data from LIGO Hanford Observatory (H1) and LIGO Livingston Observatory (L1) at 2025-08-30 03:27:09.028 UTC (GPS time: 1440559647.028). The candidate was found by the Aframe [1], cWB [2], cWB BBH [3], GstLAL [4], MBTA [5], PyCBC Live [6], and SPIIR [7] analysis pipelines.

S250830m is an event of interest because its false alarm rate, as estimated by the online analysis, is 1.2e-08 Hz, or about one in 2 years. The event's properties can be found at this URL:

https://gracedb.ligo.org/superevents/S250830m

The classification of the GW signal, in order of descending probability, is BBH (98%), Terrestrial (2%), BNS (<1%), or NSBH (<1%).

Assuming the candidate is astrophysical in origin, the probability that at least one of the compact objects is consistent with a neutron star mass (HasNS) is <1%. [8] Using the masses and spins inferred from the signal, the probability of matter outside the final compact object (HasRemnant) is <1%. [8] Both HasNS and HasRemnant consider the support of several neutron star equations of state for maximum neutron star mass. The probability that either of the binary components lies between 3 and 5 solar masses (HasMassGap) is <1%.

The source chirp mass falls with highest probability in the bin (22.0, 44.0) solar masses, assuming the candidate is astrophysical in origin.

Two sky maps are available at this time and can be retrieved from the GraceDB event page:
 * amplfi.multiorder.fits,0, an initial localization generated by AMPLFI [9], distributed via GCN and SCiMMA notices about 22 seconds after the candidate event time.
 * bayestar.multiorder.fits,0, an initial localization generated by BAYESTAR [10], distributed via GCN and SCiMMA notices about 4 minutes after the candidate event time.

The preferred sky map at this time is bayestar.multiorder.fits,0. For the bayestar.multiorder.fits,0 sky map, the 90% credible region is 3130 deg2. Marginalized over the whole sky, the a posteriori luminosity distance estimate is 3705 +/- 1112 Mpc (a posteriori mean +/- standard deviation).
