With colleagues at MIT and collaborators at University of Minnesota, I've led the deployment of a 
real-time, deep-learning-based search for colliding black holes. This is the first time deep-learning is being used 
together for both detection and parameter estimation of gravitational wave sources. See [this announcement](https://cse.umn.edu/mifa/news/umn-and-mit-launch-first-real-time-machine-learning-search-colliding-black-holes) from UMN for more information.


Compared with traditional statistical methods, deep learning approaches are faster and have a smaller computational footprint. 
Traditional statistical techniques will always have their place in science due to their interpretability. 
Still, this represents the beginning of a paradigm shift in how gravitational wave data analysis can be performed.
